## Problem-Solution Posts

### Problem Post
```
Canadian SMBs waste 10+ hours/week on repetitive tasks.

Current automation tools are:
❌ Too expensive (CAD $150-500/month)
❌ Too complex (2+ hours setup)
❌ Not Canadian (missing Shopify, Wave integrations)

There's a better way. 👇

## Tips & Best Practices

### Automation Tip
```
💡 Automation Tip: Start with one workflow

Don't try to automate everything at once. Start with one high-impact workflow:
1. Identify a repetitive task (order processing, invoicing, etc.)
2. Use a pre-built template
3. Test and iterate

Most users save 10+ hours/week with just 3-5 workflows.

⏱️ Time-Saving Tip: Automate your Shopify store

Automate order processing:
✅ Order confirmation → email → shipping label
✅ Low stock alert → Slack → reorder
✅ Customer support → AI response → email

Save 10+ hours/week with Shopify automation.
