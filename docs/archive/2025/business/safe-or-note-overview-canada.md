# SAFE / Note Overview — Canada — AIAS Platform

**Purpose:** Overview of SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity) and Convertible Notes for Canadian companies  
**Last Updated:** January 15, 2024

---

## SAFE vs. Convertible Note

### SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity)
- **Structure:** Convertible security (converts to equity at next equity round)
- **Interest:** No interest (not a debt instrument)
- **Maturity:** No maturity date (converts at equity round)
- **Valuation:** Valuation cap or discount (or both)

### Convertible Note
- **Structure:** Debt instrument (converts to equity at next equity round)
- **Interest:** Interest accrues (typically 6-8% annually)
- **Maturity:** Maturity date (typically 18-24 months)
- **Valuation:** Valuation cap or discount (or both)

---

## SAFE Terms (Recommended for AIAS Platform)

### Valuation Cap
- **Amount:** CAD $3-5M valuation cap (pre-money)
- **Purpose:** Limits conversion price (investor gets equity at lower valuation)
- **Example:** CAD $3M cap → investor converts at CAD $3M valuation (even if company raises at CAD $5M)

### Discount
- **Amount:** 15-20% discount (on next equity round)
- **Purpose:** Rewards early investors (discount on equity round price)
- **Example:** 20% discount → investor converts at 80% of equity round price

### Conversion Trigger
- **Trigger:** Next equity round (Series A, preferred stock round)
- **Conversion:** SAFE converts to preferred stock at valuation cap or discount (whichever is better for investor)

## Canadian Considerations

### Tax Implications
- **SAFE:** No interest → no tax implications until conversion
- **Convertible Note:** Interest accrues → potential tax implications (consult tax advisor)

### Securities Law
- **Exemptions:** Use prospectus exemptions (accredited investor exemption, friends/family exemption)
- **Filing:** May need to file offering memorandum (consult securities lawyer)

### GST/HST
- **SAFE:** Not subject to GST/HST (equity instrument)
- **Convertible Note:** Interest may be subject to GST/HST (consult tax advisor)

---

## Recommended Structure for AIAS Platform

### SAFE Terms
- **Investment Amount:** CAD $500K - $1M (seed round)
- **Valuation Cap:** CAD $3-5M (pre-money)
- **Discount:** 20% discount (on next equity round)
- **Conversion:** Next equity round (Series A, preferred stock round)

### Why SAFE?
- ✅ **Simple:** No interest, no maturity date (simpler than convertible note)

- ✅ **Flexible:** Can raise multiple SAFEs (different terms for different investors)
