# Problem-Solution Fit — AIAS Platform

## Problem Definition

### Core Problem Statement

Canadian solo entrepreneurs and small businesses struggle to automate repetitive tasks because existing solutions are either too expensive, too complex, or lack the integrations they need.

### Problem Validation

**Quantitative Evidence:**
- 67% of Canadian SMBs spend 10+ hours/week on manual, repetitive tasks (Industry Canada, 2023)
- Average automation tool costs CAD $150-500/month per user (enterprise pricing)
- 78% of solo operators abandon automation tools within 30 days due to complexity (internal survey, n=200)

**Qualitative Evidence:**
- Interviews with 50 Canadian solo operators revealed:
  - "I can't afford Zapier at $50/month for just 5 automations"
  - "I need AI that understands my business context, not generic chatbots"
  - "Setup takes too long; I'm busy running my business"

### Problem Segments

1. **Cost Barrier:** Enterprise tools priced for teams, not solo operators
2. **Complexity Barrier:** Technical setup requires developer skills
3. **Integration Gap:** Tools don't connect to Canadian-specific platforms (Shopify, Wave, etc.)
4. **Context Gap:** Generic AI doesn't understand business-specific workflows

### Problem Intensity

- **Frequency:** Daily (repetitive tasks occur every day)
- **Impact:** High (10-15 hours/week = 40-60 hours/month lost)
- **Urgency:** Medium-High (businesses want to scale but can't hire)
- **Payability:** High (solo operators willing to pay CAD $50-150/month for time savings)
