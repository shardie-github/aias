## Problem Statement

Enterprise capability exists but onboarding is incomplete. Missing enterprise-specific flow, SOC 2 marketing, and dedicated support. Estimated opportunity: 3x enterprise conversions.

## Solution

Build enterprise onboarding:
1. Enterprise signup flow
2. SOC 2 compliance badge/marketing
3. Dedicated support channel
4. Custom domain setup wizard

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Enterprise Signup (Days 1-7)
- Enterprise signup form
- Company info collection
- Admin user setup
- Team invitation flow

### Phase 2: SOC 2 Marketing (Days 8-12)
- SOC 2 badge on website
- Enterprise landing page
- Compliance documentation
- Security whitepaper

### Phase 3: Onboarding Wizard (Days 13-18)
- Custom domain setup
- SSO configuration
- Team member invitations
- Initial workflow setup

### Phase 4: Support & Launch (Days 19-21)
- Dedicated support channel
- Enterprise success manager intro
- Launch to beta enterprises
- Gather feedback

## Success Metrics

- **30-Day:** Onboarding flow live, 5+ enterprise trials started
- **60-Day:** Enterprise conversion rate > 10%, <7 day TTV
- **90-Day:** 20+ enterprise customers, $50K+ MRR

## Guardrails

- Require company email for enterprise signup
- Manual approval for enterprise accounts
- Dedicated support SLA (4hr response)

## Dependencies

- SOC 2 certification (if not already)
- SSO infrastructure
- Support system

## Notes

- Start with manual approval, automate later
- Consider enterprise-specific pricing page
